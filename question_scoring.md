## Scoring Methodology

### 1. Reversed Scoring Logic

For questions with reversed scoring (marked "Yes" in the tables above):
- **Adjusted Score = 6 - Response Value**

Example:
- If a respondent selects "Always" (value 5) for a reversed question, the adjusted score is: 6 - 5 = 1
- If a respondent selects "Never" (value 1) for a reversed question, the adjusted score is: 6 - 1 = 5

### 2. Raw Score Calculation

**Raw Score = Sum of all adjusted scores for each category**

For each category:
1. Apply reversed scoring to relevant questions
2. Sum all adjusted scores
3. Result is the raw score for that constitution type

### 3. Normalized Percentage Score

The normalization formula adjusts for the number of items in each category:

**For 6-item categories:**
```
Normalized % = ((Raw Score - 6) / 24) × 100
```

**For 7-item categories:**
```
Normalized % = ((Raw Score - 7) / 28) × 100
```

**For 8-item categories:**
```
Normalized % = ((Raw Score - 8) / 32) × 100
```

The normalized percentage is rounded to 2 decimal places.

### 4. Classification Criteria

#### Category A (Neutral Constitution):
- **For sure:** Normalized % ≥ 60%
- **Not:** Normalized % < 60%

#### Categories B-I (All Other Constitutions):
- **For sure:** Normalized % > 40%
- **Somewhat:** Normalized % between 30% - 40% (inclusive)
- **Not:** Normalized % < 30%

### 5. Additional Indicators

Each category also has threshold-based indicators:

- **isNormal:** Raw Score ≤ Normal Threshold
- **isPositive:** Raw Score ≥ Positive Threshold

These provide additional diagnostic information beyond the percentage-based classification.

## Interpretation Guidelines

1. **Neutral Constitution (Category A)** is the ideal balanced state. A score of "For sure" indicates optimal health balance.

2. **Multiple constitution types** can manifest simultaneously. It's common for individuals to show characteristics of 2-3 types.

3. **"For sure" classifications** indicate a strong presence of that constitutional pattern and may require attention.

4. **"Somewhat" classifications** suggest a tendency toward that pattern but not yet fully manifested.

5. **"Not" classifications** indicate the individual does not exhibit significant characteristics of that constitution type.

6. Results should be used as a guide for wellness planning and should be interpreted by qualified TCM practitioners for clinical applications.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- All scoring calculations use adjusted scores (applying reverse scoring where applicable)
- Normalization ensures comparability across categories with different numbers of items
- The system rounds normalized percentages to 2 decimal places for consistency
- Threshold values (normal/positive) are empirically derived from TCM clinical research
- Gender-specific questions in Category F should be applied conditionally based on respondent gender
